Search for sum
==============

## Intro

For context please watch the mock Google interview here:

## tl;dr

I want to know if two items in an array equal a desired sum. We can return a boolean.

There are two types of array to cover.

1. Sorted.
2. Unsorted.

Create benchmarks against the quadratic nested for loop.

If you watch the video you will see that the challenge moves from sorted to unsorted
half way through the initial coding session, so while the binary search benchmark
is still in there, it's not relatable to the bidirectional search.
